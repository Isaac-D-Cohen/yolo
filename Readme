This code is an adaptation of an implementation of YOLOv3 by Aladdin Persson.

Checkout Aladdin's video for a good
explanation of the code:

Throughout this code the comments may use regular YOLO terminology, like referring to "bounding boxes." I know that a 1-d line is not a box, but calling them "bounding lines" would probably just make things more confusing.
